# Interview Scheduler
Interview Scheduler is a Single Page Application built using React. 

A user can switch between different days and book new interviews, as well as edit or cancel the exisisting bookings. If an error were to occur, an error message would be displayed. The number of spots remaining for the day is updated dynamically as bookings are created or deleted.
